Length and distance are measurements used to determine the size, extent, or span of objects or the space between two points.

Length is typically measured using units such as centimeters (cm) or inches (in).
So, next time you need to measure something, remember to choose the appropriate unit of length based on the scale of the object or distance you are measuring.
